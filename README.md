# JavaScript Polyfills

This repository contains polyfills for various JavaScript features that may not be supported in all browsers or environments. Polyfills help ensure that your JavaScript code runs consistently across different platforms and older browsers by providing missing functionality.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind creating this repository is to provide developers with a collection of reliable polyfills that can be easily integrated into their projects. JavaScript polyfills allow developers to use modern JavaScript features and APIs, even in environments that lack support for them, enabling them to write more maintainable and future-proof code.

## Included Polyfills

The repository includes polyfills for several common JavaScript features, including:

- Array.prototype.reduce(): Provides support for the reduce method, which applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array to reduce it to a single value.

- Function.prototype.bind(): Polyfills the bind method, allowing you to bind a specific context to a function, ensuring that it is called with that context.

- Array.prototype.filter(): Provides support for the filter method, which creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

- Array.prototype.map(): Polyfills the map method, which creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array.

- Promise: Polyfills the Promise object, enabling the use of promises to handle asynchronous operations.

- Memoize: Provides a polyfill for memoization, a technique that caches the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

Each polyfill is implemented as a separate JavaScript file and is accompanied by relevant documentation and usage examples.

## Usage

To use the polyfills in your project, follow these steps:

1. Download the desired polyfill(s) from this repository or install them using a package manager like npm.

2. Include the polyfill(s) in your HTML file or JavaScript bundle using a script tag or module import, respectively.

3. Make sure to include the polyfills before using the corresponding JavaScript feature that is not supported natively.
